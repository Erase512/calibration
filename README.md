Calibration of ultrasonic Doppler flowmeters
==================

The project included a RatioNet model for calibrating an ultrasonic Doppler flow meter and flow data from a sewer network simulation experimental setup. This README file provides information on how to use and configure these components.
<br>Version: Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.13

Relevant data
------------

The data measured by the flow meter at different sewage turbidity and level is in the data folder
<br>·11-10.xlsx：The corrected flow value.

Usage method
============
You can use the following command:<br>python main.py
