Calibration of ultrasonic Doppler flowmeters
==================
The project included a RatioNet model for calibrating an ultrasonic Doppler flow meter and flow data from a sewer <br>network simulation experimental setup. This README file provides information on how to use and configure these <br>components.
Version: Python 3.6 and TensorFlow 1.13
Relevant data
------------
The data measured by the flow meter at different sewage turbidity and level is in the data folder
Usage method
